PDF Document Text Extraction Module

This module provides specialized text extraction capabilities for PDF documents
using PyMuPDF (fitz) library. It implements sampling strategies for
large documents to balance performance with content coverage, making it suitable
for production environments with diverse document sizes.

    Attributes:
        PAGE_LIMIT_FOR_SAMPLING (int): Threshold above which sampling is triggered.
            Documents with more pages will use sampling strategy.

        Extract text content from a PDF document with intelligent processing strategy.

        This method orchestrates the complete PDF text extraction workflow, including
        file validation, format verification, and content extraction. It automatically
        selects between full extraction and sampling based on document size.

        Args:
            input_path (Union[str, Path]): Path to the PDF file to process.
                Accepts both string paths and Path objects for flexibility.
                Must point to an existing, readable PDF file.

                - source_file: Original filename for tracking

        Core text extraction logic with intelligent sampling for large documents.

            - Documents â‰¤ 10 pages: Full extraction of all pages
            - Documents > 10 pages: Extract first 5 + last 5 pages
            - Content from middle pages is omitted with clear indicator
