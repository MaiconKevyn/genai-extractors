The franchise has been expanded into various films and other\nmedia, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park\nattractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. [el\nStar Wars is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\nThe original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope, was followed by\nthe sequels Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Episode VI: Return of the\nJedi (1983), forming the original Star Wars trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to\nwrite and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of Episode |: The Phantom Menace (1999),\nEpisode Il: Attack of the Clones (2002), and Episode Il: Revenge of the Sith (2005). In\n2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the\nfranchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of Episode VII: The Force Awakens\n(2015), Episode Vill: The Last Jedi (2017), and Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker\n(2019).\n\nAll nine films, collectively referred to as the \"Skywalker Saga\", were nominated for\nAcademy Awards, with Oscars going to the first three releases. Together with the\ntheatrical live action \"anthology\" films Rogue One (2016) and Solo (2018), the combined\nbox office revenue of the films equate to over US$10 billion, making Star Wars the third-\nhighest-grossing film franchise in cinematic history."
