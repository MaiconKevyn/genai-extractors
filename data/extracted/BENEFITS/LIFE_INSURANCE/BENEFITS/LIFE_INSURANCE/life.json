Many life insurance products \nalso allow policyholders to accumulate savings \nthat can be used in a time of financial need. Most \nAmerican families depend on life insurance to provide \nthis economic protection: 90 million American \nfamilies rely on life insurers’ products for financial and \nretirement security.\nAmericans purchased $3.3 trillion of new life \ninsurance coverage in 2021, a 1.3 percent decrease \nfrom 2020. By the end of 2021, total life insurance \ncoverage in the United States was $21.2 trillion, an \nincrease of 3.7 percent from 2020 (Table 7.1).\nThree types of life insurance policies predominate \nthe market. Individual insurance is underwritten \nseparately for each individual who seeks insurance \nprotection. Group insurance is underwritten on a \ngroup as a whole, such as the employees of a company \nor the members of an organization. Credit insurance \nguarantees payment of some debt, such as a mortgage \nor other loan, in the event the insured person dies, \nand can be bought on either an individual or a group \nbasis. Insurance on loans of 10 years’ or less duration \nis classified as credit insurance in National Association \nof Insurance Commissioners accounts; insurance on \nlonger loans is included in individual or group policy \ndata in this chapter. Life insurance policies offered by \nfraternal benefit societies are considered individual \ninsurance.\nINDIVIDUAL LIFE INSURANCE\nIndividual life is the most widely used form of life \ninsurance protection, accounting for 64 percent \nof all life insurance in force in the United States \nat year-end 2021 (Table 7.1). Typically purchased \nthrough life insurance agents, this insurance is issued \nunder individual policies with face amounts as low \nas $10,000, although larger minimum amounts are \nmore typical in today’s market. While individual life is \nprincipally used for family protection, it also is widely \nused for business purposes. A business may purchase \nlife insurance to protect against the economic loss \nthat would result from the death of the owner or a key \nemployee.\nIndividual life insurance protection in the United \n         7\nLife Insurance\n\n90   American Council of Life Insurers\nStates totaled $13.6 trillion at the end of 2021 and has \ngrown at an average annual rate of 2.1 percent since \n2011, when $11 trillion was in force (Table 7.1).\nThe average size of new individual life policies \npurchased has increased from $162,230 in 2011 \nto $189,830 in 2021 (Figure 7.2). The number of \nindividual policies purchased totaled 10.4 million in \n2021 (Table 7.1).\nIndividual life policies offer two basic types of \nprotection: covering a specified term, or permanently \ncovering one’s whole life.\nTypes of Policies\nTerm Insurance\nTerm insurance policies provide life insurance \ncoverage for a specified period, usually greater than \none year. Term policies provide no further benefits \nwhen the term expires, and no buildup of cash value \noccurs. If this insurance is not renewed at the end of \nits term, coverage lapses and no payment would be \nmade to the beneficiary in the event of death.\nOf new individual life policies purchased in 2021, 40 \npercent, or 4.1 million, were term insurance, totaling \n$1.4 trillion, or 71 percent, of the individual life face \namount issued (Table 7.2). The most popular form \nof term insurance is level term, which offers a fixed \npremium.\nPermanent Insurance\nUnlike term insurance, permanent life (or whole \nlife) insurance provides protection for as long as \nthe insured lives. Permanent life policies also have a \nsavings component, building cash value that can help \nfamilies meet financial emergencies, pay for special \ngoals, or provide income for retirement years.\nThere are four types of permanent life insurance \npolicies: traditional whole life, universal life (UL), \nvariable life (VL), and variable-universal life (VUL). \nThe annual premium for traditional whole life policies \nremains constant throughout the life of the policy. In \nearlier years, the premium is higher than the actual \ncost of the insurance, but in later years it becomes \nsubstantially lower than the actual cost of protection. \nThe excess amount of each premium in the early years \nis held in reserve as the policy’s cash value. This cash \nvalue grows over time from investment earnings and \nfuture premium payments, providing funds for the cost \nof coverage as the insured grows older. If a policyholder \ndecides to give up the insurance protection, he or she \nreceives the cash value upon surrendering the policy, \nless any outstanding policy loans. Universal life \nallows varying premium payment amounts subject to \na certain minimum and maximum. For variable life, \nthe death benefit and cash value vary subject to the \nperformance of a portfolio of investments chosen by \nthe policyholder. VUL combines the flexible premium \npayment options of UL with the varied investment \noptions of VL. \nIn 2021, direct purchases of permanent life constituted \n60 percent of U.S. individual life insurance policies \nissued and 29 percent of the total face amount issued \n(Table 7.2).\nParticipating and Nonparticipating \nInsurance\nTraditional whole life and term insurance policies can \nbe purchased on a participating or nonparticipating \nbasis. A participating policy allows the policyholder \nto share in the insurance company’s surplus. With this \ntype of life insurance, a policyholder receives annual \ndividends representing that portion of the premium \nnot needed by the company for death payments to\n\n91   Life Insurance\nbeneficiaries, additions to reserves, or administrative \nexpenses. More than two-thirds of individual life \npolicies’ face amount purchased were nonparticipating \nat $1.4 trillion (70%) in 2021 (Table 7.3).\nCharacteristics of Individual Policies\nLapses and Surrenders\nA policy lapses if its premium is not paid by the \nend of a specified time, often called the grace period. \nPolicyholders have different reasons for terminating \ntheir policies, sometimes using cash values to address \nfinancial emergencies or achieve long-term goals. \nRates of voluntary policy termination by policyholders \nvary considerably among life insurers. Each company’s \nrate depends on many factors, including the types of \npolicies written and the ratio of new policies to older \nones in force with the company\nThe voluntary termination rate of individual life \ninsurance policies reached 4.6 percent by 2021 (Table \n7.4). Of the individual life policies that have been \nvoluntarily terminated, 19% were surrendered based \non face amount.\nThe life insurance business vigorously seeks to \nminimize the lapsing of policies. For example, agent \ntraining focuses on realistic identification of clients’ \nlife insurance needs, and careful analysis of the use \nof family income for protection. Since the voluntary \ntermination rate is higher for policies on which loans \nare outstanding, companies urge that loans be used \nonly in genuine financial emergencies, and that they \nbe repaid promptly.\nMost insurers offer policyholders time after their \npolicy is delivered to consider whether to keep the \npolicy. These companies will refund the premium in \nfull if, within the prescribed time, the policyholder \ndecides not to keep his or her policy.\nSome policies that lapse still have a cash value, \nentitling the policyholder to some form of payment \nunder a cash surrender value non-forfeiture option. All \ncoverage under the policy terminates at the time of the \nsurrender.\nDisability Provisions\nBesides the benefit payable upon death of the insured, \nmany life insurance policies or policy riders provide \ndisability benefits to cover financial losses that \nresult from a sickness or injury. The most common \nsupplementary benefit is waiver of premium. Of \nindividual life policies in force with disability \nprovisions in 2021, 93 percent, or 33 million, allowed \nthe premium to be waived during disability. This \nrepresents $4.5 trillion, or 99 percent, of the individual \nlife face amount in force with disability provisions \n(Table 7.6).\nGROUP LIFE INSURANCE\nGroup life insurance is a contract between an insurance \ncompany and some group to insure all of the group’s \nmembers, usually under term coverage. Common \nexamples are employer-provided life insurance and \ninsurance offered through unions and professional \nassociations. Employees or other group members \nreceive certificates denoting their participation in the \ngroup coverage. In 2021, group insurance represented \n43 percent of all life insurance policies in force (Table \n7.1).\nGroup purchases decreased 11.9 percent in 2021 to \n$1.3 trillion. At the end of 2021, group life insurance \nprovided $7.5 trillion of protection, a 0.6 percent \nincrease over a year earlier (Table 7.1).\nGroup insurance contracts can provide benefits \nbeyond term insurance. Employees often can retain\n\n92   American Council of Life Insurers\ncoverage after retirement by paying premiums directly \nto the insurer. Many policies also offer survivor \nbenefits, usually continuing monthly payments to the \nspouse of an employee who dies before retirement; \npayments may extend for life or to the age at which \nSocial Security retirement payments become available, \nbut cease on remarriage. Contingent benefits to \ndependent children in the event of a spouse’s death \nare available as well. The initial value of these survivor \nbenefits can range from three to 10 times an employee’s \nannual salary.\nAs with individual life policies, group policies \ncan be purchased on either a participating or \nnonparticipating basis. Most group life policies are \nnonparticipating—95 percent of those purchased in \n2021, at $1.2 trillion (Table 7.3).\nThe voluntary termination rate of group life insurance \npolicies increased to 6.2 percent from 5.7 percent a \nyear earlier.  The voluntary lapses in 2021 increased to \n6.2 percent from 5.6 percent in 2020 (Table 7.4).\nGroup policies also provide disability benefits. Of \ngroup life policies in force with disability provisions in \n2021, 90 percent, or 95 million, provided for waiver of \npremium. This represents $5.5 trillion, or 84 percent, \nof the group life face amount in force with disability \nprovisions (Table 7.6).\nCREDIT LIFE INSURANCE\nCredit life insurance pays the balance on loans of \n10 years’ or less duration if the borrower dies before \nrepaying the amount due. At year-end 2021, $95 \nbillion of credit life insurance was in force, down 1.8 \npercent from the previous year (Table 7.1).\nCredit life, commonly part of consumer credit \ncontracts, is term insurance, generally decreasing in \namount as a loan is repaid. It protects the borrower’s \nfamily, as well as the lender, against unpaid debt \nthat may be left at death. Life insurers issue credit \ninsurance through lenders such as banks, finance \ncompanies, credit unions, and retailers, who in turn \nmake arrangements with borrowers.\nAs with other life policies, credit policies can be \npurchased on either a participating or nonparticipating \nbasis. Of credit life policies purchased in 2021, 98 \npercent, or $46 billion, were nonparticipating (Table \n7.3).\nPOLICY CLAIMS RESISTED OR \nCOMPROMISED\nFrom time to time, life insurers find it necessary \nto delay or deny payment of claims due to material \nmisrepresentation, suicide within the contestable \nperiod, or no proof of death, among other reasons. \nIn 2021, $301 million in new claims along with \n$631 million in other claims were in dispute. Of this \namount, $219 million was paid in 2021 and $363 \nmillion still resisted at the end of the year (Table 7.7).\n\n93   Life Insurance\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n1995\n1997\n1999\n2001\n2003\n2005\n2007\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2015\n2017\n2019\n2021\nCredit\nGroup\nIndividual\n$ Trillions\nFigure 7.1\nIndividual, Group, and Credit Life Insurance in Force in the United States (face amount)\nSource: ACLI tabulations of National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) data, used by permission.
